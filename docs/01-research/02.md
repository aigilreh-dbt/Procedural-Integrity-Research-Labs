Below is the institutional-grade reformulation of the specification, structured for external circulation (grant submission, standards dialogue, regulatory review). It removes internal shorthand and consolidates architecture, research claims, governance model, and validation boundaries into a formal document.

PROCEDURAL INTEGRITY SYSTEM (PIS)

Institutional Research Specification (PRS v4.0)

Status: External Distribution Draft

Intended Audience: Research Councils, Regulatory Bodies, Standards Committees, Institutional Partners

────────────────────────────────

1. Executive Abstract

The Procedural Integrity System (PIS) is a layered computational framework for analyzing structured dialogue without evaluating substantive truth. It distinguishes between:

• Procedural legality (how discourse unfolds),

• Structural semantic continuity (whether responses maintain argumentative coherence),

• Non-normative geometric diagnostics (energy / trajectory anomalies).

The system enforces a strict architectural separation between normative enforcement and semantic measurement. This design prevents epistemic overreach and preserves contestability, explainability, and cross-domain neutrality.

The core contribution is a formal, layered architecture in which:

Normative violation ≠ epistemic weakness ≠ geometric anomaly.

This separation is enforced structurally and validated experimentally.

────────────────────────────────

2. Problem Statement

Existing AI systems that analyze discourse typically:

• Conflate weak reasoning with procedural fault,

• Collapse semantic assessment into normative sanction,

• Lack reproducible structural diagnostics,

• Depend on opaque neural inference.

This creates regulatory, epistemic, and governance risks.

The Procedural Integrity System addresses these by:

1. Restricting normative signals to procedural commitments only.

2. Making semantic degradation structurally measurable.

3. Constraining geometric/embedding analysis to non-authoritative diagnostic layers.

4. Ensuring reproducibility and deterministic execution paths.

────────────────────────────────

3. Architectural Overview

The system is composed of three strictly ordered layers.

Layer 1 — Procedural Core (Authoritative)

Function:

Tracks commitments, move legality, dialogue phases, and obligation flow.

Properties:

• Deterministic

• No semantic interpretation

• No embeddings

• Normative authority resides only here

Outputs:

• normative\_violation\_marked (boolean)

• explanation\_item\_created (procedural only)

Layer 2 — Structural Semantics (Deterministic Measurement)

Function:

Detects structural degradation patterns without interpreting truth.

Implements:

• Topic continuity (lexical \+ latent SVD space)

• Claim preservation heuristics

• Structural silence (filibuster-style expansion)

• Entropy and compression proxies

Constraints:

• Deterministic math only

• No LLM dependence

• No psychological inference

• No lie detection

Outputs:

• semantic\_signal\_marked

• degradation\_flag (low/medium/high)

• feature vector (auditable)

Layer 3 — Geometric Overlay (Read-Only Diagnostic Mode)

Function:

Measures trajectory anomalies in semantic space.

Implements:

• Cosine drift metrics

• Obligation gradient mapping

• Persistence-based cyclic detection (TDA windowed)

• Procedural Energy Proxy (PEP)

Constraints:

• Cannot block or sanction

• Cannot override Layer 1

• Must translate into procedural vocabulary

• Version-pinned embedding models

Outputs:

• computed\_signal

• anomaly\_score

• translation\_to\_structural\_template

Layer Ordering Constraint:

Layer N cannot modify or override decisions of Layer N−1.

────────────────────────────────

4. Core Axiomatic Foundation

The system is grounded in a procedural argumentation axiom set:

A1. Environmental admissibility

A2. Teleological priority

A3. Procedural realizability

A4. Commitment integrity

A5. Separation of persuasion and correctness

A6. Dynamic convergence

A7. Detectable degeneration

These axioms define procedural legality independently of epistemic content.

────────────────────────────────

5. Normative Separation Principle

Formal Statement:

Epistemic inadequacy alone does not license normative sanction.

Normative escalation requires explicit procedural violation (commitment contradiction, illegal move, or profile-defined obligation breach).

Geometric anomalies cannot escalate without structural corroboration.

This is enforced programmatically.

────────────────────────────────

6. Validation and Reproducibility Framework

All experiments adhere to:

• Deterministic execution

• Versioned profiles

• Frozen core

• Golden-run regression tests

• No stochastic inference in normative layers

Validation artifacts include:

• Snapshot logs (jsonl)

• Profile signature hashes

• Core version ID

• Differential reports (cross-profile comparisons)

The system supports reproducible scenario replay across profiles.

────────────────────────────────

7. Profile-Based Normative Pluralism

The engine supports multiple normative regimes:

• research\_freeplay

• legal\_audit

• domain-specific regulated profiles

Profiles may alter:

• escalation thresholds

• explanation verbosity

• obligation strictness

Profiles may not alter:

• core procedural legality

• structural measurement math

• embedding computations

This preserves normative pluralism without semantic drift.

────────────────────────────────

8. Legal Audit Deployment Model

Minimum viable deployment includes:

• Offline text ingestion

• Deterministic structural analysis

• Procedural explanation report

• No truth judgment

• No reputational scoring

All outputs framed as:

“Procedural structure indicates…”

Never:

“Argument is false”

“Speaker is deceptive”

This ensures regulatory defensibility.

────────────────────────────────

9. Data Governance Policy

Accepted Data:

• Public transcripts

• Licensed institutional records

• Anonymized professional exchanges

Prohibited:

• Illicitly obtained materials

• Deception-classification datasets

• Psychological profiling data

The system analyzes structure, not personal credibility.

────────────────────────────────

10. Research Program Roadmap

Phase I–III: Core formalization

Phase IV: Explainability minimal model

Phase V: Profile differentiation

Phase VI: Structural semantic hardening

Phase VII: Domain validation (Legal Audit)

Phase VIII: Visualization & analytics

Phase IX: Institutional interface layer

Future research tracks:

• Topological measurement invariants

• Cross-lingual structural transfer

• Wasserstein dialogue geometry

• Formal convergence bounds

────────────────────────────────

11. Standards & Regulatory Alignment

The architecture aligns with:

• Explainable AI principles (traceable outputs)

• Contestability frameworks

• Separation-of-concern engineering standards

• AI governance best practices

• Risk-tiered regulatory models (e.g., EU AI Act compliance posture)

Key compliance property:

No autonomous sanction without procedural justification.

────────────────────────────────

12. Risk Controls

Risk: Black-box embedding drift

Mitigation: Version pinning \+ reproducibility manifests

Risk: Normative overreach

Mitigation: Hard-coded layer authority hierarchy

Risk: Misuse as lie detector

Mitigation: Explicit prohibition \+ architectural impossibility

Risk: Semantic overinterpretation

Mitigation: Template-based explanations only

────────────────────────────────

13. Institutional Positioning

The Procedural Integrity System constitutes:

• Infrastructure for procedural governance

• Computational argumentation platform

• Standards-ready dialogue compliance layer

• Research-grade reproducible normative engine

It is not:

• A persuasion scoring engine

• A credibility classifier

• A sentiment tool

• A generative AI wrapper

It defines a new category:

Procedural-Normative Infrastructure for Structured Dialogue.

────────────────────────────────

14. Deliverables for Grant or Standards Submission

Available artifacts:

• Formal PRS v4.0

• Scenario library (controlled)

• Profile behavior matrix

• Acceptance matrices (Legal Audit v1)

• Differential analytics engine

• Reproducibility manifest format

• Research cycle documentation

Optional extensions:

• Regulatory compliance annex

• ISO-style conformance mapping

• Technical standard draft outline

• External API specification draft

────────────────────────────────

15. Closing Position

The system establishes a formally layered, reproducible, normatively neutral architecture for dialogue analysis.

Its principal innovation is architectural:

The enforced separation of procedural legality, structural semantics, and geometric diagnostics.

This separation is the basis for institutional trust, regulatory compatibility, and research scalability.
